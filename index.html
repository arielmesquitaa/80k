            <h2>"The average BART employee makes 80k a year"</h2>
            
            <p>
                We have heard this phrase often since the first BART strike happened in July, and it has caused a lot of public resentment.  But it does not tell us why unionized BART workers are striking, nor is it even an accurate representation of the average unionized worker's salaries.  Here, we try to figure out how much a unionized BART worker makes, the cost of living that they are trying to maintain, and how the negotiations will impact them.

            <h4>motivations</h4>
            <p>
                I started hearing this phrase over and over again when the first BART strike began in July.  Like many others, I was outraged; how dare these workers inconvenience my commute when they're making so much already?  And then I started to realize that there must be so much more to the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                For one, the cost of living in the Bay Area is ridiculous.  80k is very reasonable if you are only supporting yourself, but for a lot of BART workers that may not be the case.  They likely have families to support.  For another, what does 80k really mean?  Is it the average of their base salaries or their total costs of employment?  And who are included in this average?  Certainly, if management salaries are included, it'd unreasonably skew the data!
            </p>
            <p>
                And thus I have attempted to gather here the Bay Area costs of living, past and present BART and union negotiations, and union employee salaries, in the hopes of better understanding the situation.
